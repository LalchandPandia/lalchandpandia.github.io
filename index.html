Introduction: I am an NLP enthusiast with an interest in Natural Language Understanding. Previously, I did my Masters in <a href="https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/">Computer Science</a> from <a href="http://www.iitk.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur</a> in 2017. I was fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/new/dr-harish-karnick">Dr. Harish Karnick</a>. In my thesis, we investigated to use bidirectional LSTMs to capture longer context in order to solve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word-sense_disambiguation">Word-Sense Disambiguation</a>. My thesis can be found <a href="https://github.com/lalchand-pandia/Word-Sense-Disambiguation-by-learning-long-term-dependencies">here</a>.
